# Fast and Cubic

Once upon a time there was a land of orange cubes. But the unexpected mutation made all the cubes mutate and change their color. Only one of the cubes "cube warrior" remained sensible and an unknown virus gave him unprecedented powers.

Will the cube warrior be able to break through the hordes of mutated brothers? It is only up to you.

Play the dynamic, action game which can be fully adapted to your playing style with an extensive options system. Complete countless levels in the shortest possible time and become the true king of cubes.

Challenge your friends, play together (on separate computers, it's not multiplayer lol) and see which of you is able to pass the game without a single death!

Game made after one week of learning Unity. Hope you enjoy :D
